ðŸš€ Zomato Restaurant Analysis â€“ Hackathon Project (Innomatics Research Labs)
This project was built as part of a Hackathon conducted by Innomatics Research Labs. It was my first-ever hackathon experience, and it turned out to be a fantastic learning opportunity! ðŸ”¥

The objective was to explore and analyze a real-world dataset from Zomato to extract meaningful insights about restaurant trends, pricing, customer preferences, and geographic patterns. I implemented extensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and geospatial visualizations using Folium to better understand restaurant density and cuisine distributions in Bangalore.

While I did make a few mistakes along the way, each one taught me something new about handling real-time data and overcoming practical issues that arise when working on live datasets. From debugging errors to interpreting outliers and choosing the right visualizations â€” this experience gave me a hands-on taste of solving real business problems using data.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Skills Practiced:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis

Geospatial Visualization with Folium

GroupBy Aggregations

Real-time Problem Solving

Overall, this project not only helped me sharpen my technical skills but also boosted my confidence in handling real datasets under time constraints. Definitely a milestone in my data journey! âœ¨
